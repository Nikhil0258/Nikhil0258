## 🏢 Professional Experience

### Data Engineer | Accenture
**Client: McDonald's** | Jan 2023 – Present | India

Worked on a large-scale, enterprise data platform supporting multi-country restaurant operations. My role involved building and maintaining reliable data pipelines, automation, and production workflows that form the foundation for analytics and AI-driven systems.

#### Key Responsibilities & Impact:
- Designed and supported Python-based data processing pipelines for transforming raw datasets into structured, analytics-ready formats
- Built automation scripts using Python (Pandas, NumPy) to generate reports and structured outputs, reducing manual effort and improving data reliability
- Performed data validation, reconciliation, and quality checks using SQL to ensure accuracy of downstream data consumers
- Worked with AWS services (S3, Redshift, Athena) for data ingestion, storage, and querying
- Supported workflow orchestration using Apache Airflow (DAG-level support) and collaborated via GitHub-based CI/CD pipelines
- Actively resolved production incidents, performed root-cause analysis, and ensured minimal downtime for critical data workflows
- Collaborated closely with onshore stakeholders, product owners, and testing teams to explain data issues, fixes, and design decisions

#### Relevance to AI / GenAI Work:
- Gained strong experience in structured data preparation, which directly feeds into RAG systems and LLM-based applications
- Developed a production mindset around reliability, monitoring, and correctness — critical for deploying AI systems safely
- Hands-on exposure to scalable data pipelines that serve as the backbone for AI-driven analytics and intelligent applications
